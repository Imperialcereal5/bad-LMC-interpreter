# bad-LMC-interpreter
a not very good lmc interpreter with horrible error handling (but the instructions work I think???)
almost exactly what it says on the tin. Write the assembly in code.txt, I think you can use spaces but I wouldn't push your luck.
You can also write the code in a different file but make sure that the path in the ifstream is correct.
